		<p>  The 2023 Season of Game Jams has officially started, and with it, our will of creation. </p>
		<p>  We are proud to announce our first result of the year. Our new game, "Maze of Distorted Memories", got ranked 14th out of 41 entries. </p>
		<p>  The theme all contestants needed to work with was “alone”. Our game is basically a puzzle-horror game, where your biggest fear is your past. Without giving you any more information on the game, you can find out more about it by installing it using the link in our bio and playing it yourself.! </p>

Despite all the unfavorable circumstances we have encountered, we still managed to finish 4th! Huge moment and huge performance for our team, and this is only the beginning. </p>

		<p> The Game Boosters Team are participating at their first ever game-developing contest togheter! 
			The contest is hosted by: One Minute Jam (itch.io). The theme all the team members need to work 
			on is: PUMPKINS! </p>
		<p> Now, about One Minute Jam. One Minute Game is an experimental jam based on one rule:
			The gameplay must last one minute only. This is not rigidly enforced, but in the spirit of the 
			jam, keep it as close as possible! If you're looking for an optional challenge or theme, try making
			 a game that lasts a minute without the use of a countdown timer. Games from any genre are welcome. </p>
